- **Game:** 
- **Server region/language:** 
- **Server timezone (location or offset):** 
- **Server daily reset time:** 
- **(Optional) Does the server reset time change during the server's daylight savings?** For example, if the reset time is 05:00 during PST and also 05:00 during PDT, you would answer `No`. If the reset time changed to 06:00 during PDT, you would answer `Yes`. This question only applies if the server itself changes timezones during daylight savings. **If unsure, skip this question.**
